# Banknotes Classifier

This repository contains code for a neural network-based system designed to authenticate and classify banknotes as either genuine or counterfeit.

## Overview

Counterfeiting of banknotes is a significant issue, and accurate authentication is crucial for financial institutions and businesses. This project aims to address this problem by leveraging the power of neural networks to classify banknotes based on their features.

## Features

- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network model.
- Includes a dataset of banknote features and labels for training and testing.
- Implements a binary classification model to classify banknotes as genuine or counterfeit.
- Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy for assessing model performance.
